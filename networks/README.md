# Network Files

## Directory contents

This directory contains processed PPI network files. PPI data is pulled from BioGRID and cross-referenced with Ensembl and from the EBI-EMBL Molecular Interactions Ontology.

Each network file is the known interactome for one species. Only one-to-one PPIs are listed, as per BioGRID.

For quality control, many interactions are not inlcuded:
1. Self-loops (PPIs where both interactors are the same protein)
2. Interspecies interactions (PPIs where the two interactors are from two different species)
3. Non-physical PPIs (any BioGRID interactions that aren't annotated with an EBI-EMBL Molecular Interactions Ontology code of MI:0407 - direct interaction or one of its descendents are excluded, see http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/MI_0407 and https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/mi/terms?iri=http%3A%2F%2Fpurl.obolibrary.org%2Fobo%2FMI_0407)
4. Predicted PPIs (any BioGRID interactions that aren't annotated with an EBI-EMBL Molecular Interactions Ontology code of MI:0045 - experimental detection method or one of its descendents are excluded, see http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/MI_0045 and https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/mi/terms?iri=http%3A%2F%2Fpurl.obolibrary.org%2Fobo%2FMI_00407)

## File details

Each network file is named with a format `<species_short_name>.network-<Ensembl version>-<BioGRID version>.txt`
  
Each file contains two tab-separated columns of protein names. Each line of the file represents 1 PPI. Proteins / interactors are named using their Ensembl protein names for simplicity. If other protein IDs are needed, they can be looked up using `classes/Protein.py`.

The top of the file includes comments detailing the origin of the file and presenting some statistics / warnings from its generation. Comment lines are indicated with a leading `!`. There may also be blank lines within the file for readability.

## File preparation
These files are generated by `python/network/get_el.py`. Dependencies exist with `classes/Protein.py` and `classes/Species.py`.

This process uses input files in the `biogrid` and `ensembl` directories, and other files in `python/network/`.
